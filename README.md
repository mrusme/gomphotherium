Gomphotherium
-------------

Gomphotherium (*/ˌɡɒmfəˈθɪəriəm/*; "welded beast"), a command line Mastodon 
client.

## Info

As [I have left](https://xn--gckvb8fzb.com/project-updates-q3-2021/#gomphotherium) 
the Fediverse for now, this project is dormant and won't be updated any longer.
It is however in a usable state and does everything a basic CLI/TUI client is
supposed to do. I will however continue to accept PRs. If you're interested in
actively maintaining it, feel free to ping me.


## Description

Gomphotherium is a Mastodon client for the command line, offering a CLI as well
as a TUI with a usage similar to [rainbowstream](rainbowstream). It is intended
to be used at 80 characters width maximum, but ideally inside [tmux][tmux] as
a sidebar-style program.

## User Manual


### Authentication

To authenticate with your Mastodon instance, run the following command and
follow the instructions:

```sh
gomphotherium authenticate https://YOUR-MASTODON-SERVER-URL-HERE.com
```


### TUI

Launch the TUI with the following command:

```sh
gomphotherium tui
```

**Note:** If you haven't exported the required environment variables that were
shown to you during the [Authentication][#authentication], please do so first
or use the CLI flags (`gomphotherium -h`) instead.


#### Modes

The TUI can be operated in two modes: **Normal** and **Command**.

In **Normal** mode no interaction is possible apart from scrolling and 
refreshing the timeline and quitting Gomphotherium. The shortcuts can be looked
up on the [cheatsheet](#cheatsheet)

In **Command** mode, the command input becomes available and scrolling the
timeline is not possible anymore. Commands can then be issued to interact with
the Mastodon instance.
